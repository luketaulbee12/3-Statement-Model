# 3-Statement Financial Model

## Project Overview
This project involves building a **3-statement financial model**, following a structured approach to forecasting financial statements. The model includes the **income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement**, ensuring they are dynamically linked for accurate financial analysis.

## Key Components of the Model

1. **Assumptions & Forecasting**
   - Established a **set of assumptions** to project financial performance.
   - Forecasted key income statement line items, including **revenue, expenses, and net income**.

2. **Fixed Assets Schedule & Depreciation**
   - Created a **fixed assets schedule** to track capital expenditures.
   - Forecasted **depreciation expense** using straight-line or declining balance methods.

3. **Interest Expense Calculation**
   - Incorporated **debt and interest expense projections** to finalize the income statement.

4. **Balance Sheet Forecast**
   - Developed a forecast for **assets, liabilities, and equity**.
   - Deferred cash and revolver (credit facility) calculations until later stages.

5. **Cash Flow Statement Integration**
   - Linked the **cash flow statement** with the income statement and balance sheet.
   - Ensured proper reconciliation and forecasting of cash flow components.

6. **Cash & Revolver Adjustments**
   - Incorporated a **revolving credit facility (revolver)** to prevent negative cash balances.
   - Plugged the **ending cash balance** from the cash flow statement into the balance sheet.

7. **Circular Reference Resolution**
   - Addressed and resolved **circularity issues** that can arise from interdependencies in financial statements.
